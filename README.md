# teaching_and_presentation_mat
This is the place where I am dumping my selected handwritten notes for few subjects and presentations. I intend to use this space as my backup. If you find it useful, please feel free to use it.
I use them while preparing teaching materials for Machine Learning and its applications across different domains.
