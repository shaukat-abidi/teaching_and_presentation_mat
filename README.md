## Lectures
This is the place where I am dumping my selected handwritten notes for important subjects. I intend to use this space as my backup. If you find it useful, please feel free to use it.
I use them while preparing teaching materials for Machine Learning and its applications across different domains. 

## Presentations
"presentations" folder contains few useful presentations for machine learning applications. CRF one may contain some typos and minor glitches. 

I have delivered these presentations in front academics, researches and students of diverse backgrounds.
