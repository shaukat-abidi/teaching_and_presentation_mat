## Lectures
This is the place where I am dumping my selected handwritten notes for important subjects. If you find it useful, please feel free to use it.
I use them while preparing teaching materials for Machine Learning and its applications across different domains. Lecture notes are prepared from the following online courses:

 - AndrewNG_SequenceModels: **"Sequence Models"** by Andrew Ng

 - BayesianMethod_for_ML: **"Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning"** by National Research University Higher School of Economics (https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning). Russians are known for mathematics, we can witness here. Although not very complex as topics in pure mathematics, its fun to go through this course.

 - BinarySVM_derivation: A simple derivation of Binary SVM (Hard margin and soft margin case). The dual representation helps in gaining the better understanding of Kernel matrix.

 -  CNN_AndrewNG: **"Convolutional Neural Networks"** by Andrew Ng

 - LinearAlgerbra_GilbertStrang: **"Linear Algebra"** by Gilbert Strang. Must for every student in Applied Engineering and Sciences. (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/)

 - MachineLearning_Joachims: **"Machine Learning"** by Thorsten Joachim at Cornell University

 - ReinforcementLearning_notes_INTRO_AndrewNG: This is the introduction of Reinforcement learning, taken from the last lectures of Machine Learning from Stanford Engineering Everywhere (SEE).

## Presentations
"presentations" folder contains few useful presentations for machine learning applications. CRF one may contain some typos and minor glitches. 

I have delivered these presentations in front academics, researches and students of diverse backgrounds.
